# React Dashboard challenge by primer.io

Dashboard is the go-to product of Primer for our merchants to manage their payment infrastructure and gather live information about their payment ecosystem.

This project was bootstrapped with [Primer React Boilerplate](https://github.com/primer-io/react-challenge-boilerplate).

## Setup

The external libraries and lint used are listed below:
To have the best experience please try to install the libraries locally, including the editor plugins listed in the lint section

### Some External Libraries

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router#readme)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

### Lint

- [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

### Installation

- Clone this repo

- In the project directory, you can run: `npm install`

- Install eslint, prettier, and stylelint extensions on your code editor to use lint (installation depends on your editor).

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run the scripts:

### Preview locally

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run Tests

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run coverage`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Also shows the percentage of test coverage made.

`npm run coverage-report`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Also shows the percentage of test coverage made, then generates a detailed HTML report showing sections on the code not coverage in the tests.\
To view reports:

- Open to coverage folder in the root dir (Note: this is generated after you run the coverage report command as shown above)
- Open to Icov-report
- Open the index.html

### Generate Build

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Eject

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
